This is the tutorial level

I studied Mechanical Engineering so that I wouldn't have to deal with the witch-craft of electronics and programming and look where it got me. Jokes aside this stuff is super cool and I'm eager to learn more. Right now I'm in over my head with Laravel and I want to up my game by learning more about Vue.
